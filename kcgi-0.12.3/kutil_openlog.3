.Dt KUTIL_OPENLOG 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kutil_openlog
.Nd configure log message sink
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.Ft "int"
.Fo kutil_openlog
.Fa "const char *file"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kutil_openlog
function configures output for the
.Xr kutil_log 3
family of functions.
By default, these functions log to
.Dv stderr
and inherit the initial output buffering behaviour
.Pq see Xr setvbuf 3 .
.Pp
If
.Fa file
is not
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn kutil_openlog
first redirects
.Vt stderr
to
.Fa file .
Then, regardless of whether
.Fa file
is
.Dv NULL ,
the output buffering of the stream is set to line buffered.
.Pp
CGI scripts invoking long-running child processes via
.Xr fork 2
should use this function with a valid
.Fa file
as the web server might wait for all file descriptors to close before
closing the request connection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn kutil_openlog
function returns zero on failure (system error) and non-zero on success.
If
.Fn kutil_openlog
fails to re-open
.Vt stderr ,
the output stream may no longer be operable: the caller should exit.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Fn kutil_openlog
function was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@bsd.lv .
.Sh CAVEATS
In most situations,
.Fa file
is configured in the default log directory, which is not writable to the
CGI process.
Thus,
.Fa file
must be pre-created and be writable to the CGI process.
Otherwise,
.Fn kutil_openlog
will fail to create the file and exit with failure.

.Sh NAME

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn khttpdigest_validate
and
.Fn khttpdigest_validatehash
functions validate the given
.Fa password
(or a pre-combined
.Fa hash )
with the HTTP digest-authorised request
.Fa req
as returned by
.Xr khttp_parse 3
or
.Xr khttp_fcgi_parse 3 .
It fully implements all components of the digest: QOP, MD5 types, etc.
It
.Em does not
check that the URI component of the digest matches that of the request,
as these values are known to be mutable.
.Pp
The
.Fn khttpdigest_validate
function will compute a hash from the request and password;
.Fn khttpdigest_validatehash
operates on a pre-computed hash value.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn khttpdigest_validate
and
.Fn khttpdigest_validatehash
will return zero if validation failed, less than zero if the request was
not properly set up for HTTP digest validation (no HTTP method, not a
digest request, not already authenticated by the web server), or greater
than zero if the validation succeeded.

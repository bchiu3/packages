.Dt KJSON_PUTDOUBLE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kjson_putdouble ,
.Nm kjson_putdoublep ,
.Nm kjson_string_putdouble
.Nd put floating point content for kcgijson
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgijson
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.In kcgijson.h
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo kjson_putdouble
.Fa "struct kjsonreq *req"
.Fa "double v"
.Fc
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo kjson_putdoublep
.Fa "struct kjsonreq *req"
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fa "double v"
.Fc
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo kjson_string_putdouble
.Fa "struct kjsonreq *req"
.Fa "double v"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Write a double-precision floating point
.Fa v
to a context
.Fa req
initialised with
.Xr khtml_open 3 .
This formats the value using the
.Qq g
format character of
.Xr printf 3 .
If
.Fa v
does not classify as normal, subnormal, or zero, it is output as
.Dv null .
.Pp
The
.Fn kjson_putdouble
form is for array scopes,
.Fn kjson_putdoublep
is for objects, and
.Fn kjson_string_putdouble
for open strings.
.Pp
Passing a
.Dv NULL
value to
.Fa name
for
.Fn kjson_putdoublep ,
is equivalent to calling
.Fn kjson_putdouble .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns an
.Ft enum kcgi_err
indicating the error state.
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Dv KCGI_OK
Success (not an error).
.It Dv KCGI_ENOMEM
Internal memory allocation failure.
.It Dv KCGI_HUP
The output connection has been terminated.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_FORM
The connection is still expecting headers with
.Xr khttp_head 3 .
Indicates that
.Xr khttp_body 3
did not return with success or was not invoked.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_SYSTEM
Internal system error writing to the output stream.
.It Dv KCGI_WRITER
The incorrect form was used for the current scope, for example, an
array-type write within an object.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following outputs a simple JSON document.
It assumes
.Va r
is a
.Vt struct kreq
pointer.
For brevity, it does not do any error checking.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_STATUS],
  "%s", khttps[KHTTP_200]);
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_CONTENT_TYPE],
  "%s", kmimetypes[KMIME_APP_JSON]);
khttp_body(r);
kjson_open(&req, r);
kjson_obj_open(&req);
kjson_putdoublep(&req, "bar", 0.12345);
kjson_arrayp_open(&req, "baz");
kjson_putdouble(&req, (1.0 / 0.0)); /* null */
kjson_close(&req);

.Sh NAME
.Nm khttp_free ,
.Nm khttp_child_free
.Nd free a CGI instance for kcgi
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.Ft void
.Fo khttp_free
.Fa "struct kreq *req"

.Ft void
.Fo khttp_child_free

.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn khttp_free
and
.Fn khttp_child_free
functions free the resources of
.Fa req
allocated by
.Xr khttp_parse 3
or
.Xr khttp_fcgi_parse 3 ,
flushing the HTTP data stream in the process.
After calling this function, the members of
.Fa req
should not be used and the function should not be called again.
.Pp
The
.Fn khttp_child_free
function performs the same operations as
.Fn khttp_free ,
but does not flush the HTTP data stream.
Thus, it may be used after invoking
.Xr fork 2
without confusing the output buffer.
.Pp
.Em Note :
if you're forking within your CGI application, be aware of some caveats.
Most web servers will continue to wait while
.Dv stdout ,
.Dv stderr ,
and
.Dv stdin
are open to the CGI application.
Thus, if you fork a long-running application, you must close out these
file descriptors.

The
.Fn khttp_free
and
.Fn khttp_child_free
functions were written by

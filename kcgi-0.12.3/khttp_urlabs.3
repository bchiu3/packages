.Sh DESCRIPTION
Format an absolute (full) URL.
The
.Fa host
is in some standards called the
.Qq authority .
.Pp
.Dl Fa scheme Ns :// Ns Fa host : Ns Fa port Ns / Ns Fa path Ns ?key=val
.Dl Fa scheme Ns :// Ns Fa host : Ns Fa port Ns / Ns Fa path
.Dl Fa scheme : Ns Fa path
.Pp
Passing a
.Dv NULL
or empty
.Fa host
will omit the
.Qq // ,
.Fa host ,
.Fa port
component.
.Pp
If the
.Fa host
is non-empty and not
.Dv NULL
and the
.Fa path
is also non-empty and not
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fa path
is prepended with a mandatory slash.
.Pp
If the
.Fa port
is zero, it is omitted.
The
.Fa port
is only used if
.Fa host
is non-empty and not
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The variable arguments are arranged in pairs terminated by a single
.Dv NULL .
The first of each pair is the query string key, the second is the value.
Both are
.Vt "char *" .
A
.Dv NULL
query string value is rendered as an empty string.
.Pp
Only the query string pairs are URL-encoded, so the caller must make
sure that the characters in
.Fa host
and
.Fa path
are valid.
.Pp
The deprecated form of these functions,
.Fn kutil_urlabs ,
should no longer be used.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Return newly-allocated strings that must be freed with
.Xr free 3
or
.Dv NULL
if allocation fails.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To print a full URL:
.Pp
.Dl khttp_urlabs(KSCHEME_HTTPS, "foo.com", 80, "b", "c", "d", NULL);
.Pp
This assigns
.Li https://foo.com:80/b?c=d .
.Pp
Setting the port to zero eliminates the port:
.Pp
.Dl khttp_urlabs(KSCHEME_HTTPS, "foo.com", 0, "b", "c", "d", NULL);
.Pp
This assigns
.Li https://foo.com/b?c=d .
.Pp
An empty path component ends with the domain (or query string).
.Pp
.Dl khttp_urlabs(KSCHEME_HTTPS, "foo.com", 0, "", "c", "d", NULL);
.Pp
This assigns
.Li https://foo.com?c=d .
.Pp
To use a host-less scheme, specify a
.Dv NULL
or empty host:
.Pp
.Dl khttp_urlabs(KSCHEME_MAILTO, NULL, 0, "k@b.com", NULL);
.Pp
This assigns
.Li mailto:k@b.com .

.Sh CAVEATS
These functions can currently be used to create semantically invalid
URLs such as
.Li https:?foo=bar
by omitting components required for the scheme.
Semantically-correct URLs are the responsibility of the caller.
This behaviour may be verified for correctness in later versions of the
software.
